# act-scio

## DEPRECATED

This reposistory is deprecated. The project is reimplemented in python and development is moved to [https://github.com/mnemonic-no/act-scio2](https://github.com/mnemonic-no/act-scio2).

## Requirements

SCIO requires a working clojure environment to build and beanstalkd/java to run.

### Beanstalkd

The scio platform uses the beanstalkd mq. This must be installed and running.

## Installation

### Clone repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mnemonic-no/act-scio.git
cd act-scio
```

### Download vendor files to vendor/ (OpenNLP models, Geo names and TLDs)

This will populate the vendor/ directory.

```bash
scripts/get-vendor-files.sh
```

### To run locally

In the repository root, run this command to create a local config (etc/scio.ini.local)
where all directories points to our local repository.

This step is required to run the tests.

```bash
sed "s#/opt/scio#$(pwd)#g" etc/scio.ini > etc/scio.ini.local
```

Create directoy for storing documents.

```bash
mkdir documents
```

### System wide installation

Copy required files to /opt/scio:

```bash
mkdir -p /opt/scio/documents
cp -r etc vendor /opt/scio
```

Change ownership of documents to the user running scio:

```bash
chown -R scio /opt/scio/documents
```

### To build

```bash
lein uberjar
lein test
```

## Testing

```bash
lein test
```

## Usage


```bash
java -jar ./target/uberjar/scio-back-[VERSION]-standalone.jar --config etc/scio.ini.local
```

Config file defaults to /etc/scio.ini if not specified.


### Running as a service

A systemd compatible service script can be found under examples/systemd.

To install (requires latest uberjar in /opt/scio):

```bash
cp examples/systemd/scio-back.service /usr/lib/systemd/system
systemctl enable scio-back.service
examples/systemd/upgrade-latest.sh
```

The upgrade script will create a symlink from the latest uberjar found in /opt/scio.
